I am a Canadian software engineer, based in Seattle (for now). I love building things and working in fast moving environments. So far that has worked well in the startup culture, and I am currently on the engineering team at <a href="https://www.convoy.com" target="_blank">Convoy</a>.

I spend my downtime trying to get outside, drinking good beer and coffee, and exploring ways to build software. I decided to try to start documenting these explorations, and will be posting about them here.
