I have been training on my bike for most of the year, and it culminated last week at [RAMROD 2019](http://www.redmondcyclingclub.org/RAMROD/RAMROD.html). I did the ride last year as well, and had decided to challenge myself to do it a second time this year.

I didn't hit my goal of doing it in less time than last year, but that is ok. I managed to do it without falling off my bike, so I consider that a win.
