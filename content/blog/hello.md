Howdy. I'm a software engineer, and this is my blog. I like building software, riding bicycles, and playing with gadgets.

I spend most of my energy focussed on [work](https://www.convoy.com) at the moment, but in my off time I've been working on side projects to learn new technologies, explore design patterns, and try to keep my knowledge as up to date as is possible in this crazy world.

This blog is a place to write about some of the things I work on, but really, its a cool use of my sweet new `moseley.dev` domain name.
