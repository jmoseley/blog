In our new house, I basically have been given free reign of the garage. Its too small for a car, so I have decided to turn it into my workspace. I plan for it to be a place where I can get better at doing my own maintenance on bicycles, plus provide a place to work on other home projects. The most important piece of any good bike maintenance center is a nice bike stand. I've never had space for one, so I was excited to get something high quality and dependable.

I looked at many options for floor stands, coming a variety of folding or not folding, tripods, flat bases, etc. I was worried about a floor stand taking up too much floor space in the garage, making me lean towards a folding stand, but the folding stands tend to be more flimsy, or I might just not use it. After a lot of research I came across a project where someone [mounted their stand to the ceiling](http://www.tearsforgears.com/2013/01/close-quarters-work-stand.html?m=1). I loved the idea, and it would work great for my space. I did decide to use a Park Tool bike clamp, as these are well built and can mount directly to the t-slot profile.

The above post also introduced me to [8020.net](http://www.8020.net), a very cool product to be used for prototyping and building one-off mechanical structures.

I did a bit of sketching and ordered some parts from 8020 (BOM is below). Sadly, I was bad at judging the strength of the material and the strength requirements for the project, and I chose the 10 series. This was a bit too flimsy, and it flexed under the weight of a bike, making it unstable. It looked very nice though.

After that failure, I was able to return the parts, and I went back to the drawing board. I selected dual wide 40 series profile instead, to increase torsion strength as well as prevent flexion against the mounts/ceiling. I also adjusted the lengths of the profiles, getting exactly as needed to span the joists and reach down from the ceiling. This turned out much better, and is very stable with a bike on it.
