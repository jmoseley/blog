Today I learned about `NOWAIT` for PostgreSQL. This is an option for the `SELECT FOR UPDATE` command, allowing you to control the behavior of locking rows during a transaction. We use `SELECT \* FROM table WHERE col = 'value' FOR UPDATE` to provide exclusivity when updating certain objects in the database. Adding the `NOWAIT` option causes this statement to error and return immediately if the row is already locked, allowing the application to handle this case in a more interesting way than simply waiting indefinitely.
