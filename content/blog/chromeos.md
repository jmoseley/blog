I have recently purchased a Google Pixelbook to help satisfy my curiosity about the feasibility of a non-OSX platform for development. I plan to use the Pixelbook as my daily driver, and I'm writing a series of blog posts about the experience.

For the last 5 years, since I graduated from university, I have used a Macbook Pro as my main device for doing development. This started during my last co-op (aka internship) in San Fransico, where I used a Macbook for the first time, and I soon bought my own for working on personal projects. At Convoy, my current job, we also use Macbook Pros, so it has been very comfortable to use the same operating system both at home and at work. I have a windows desktop, but that is used only for the small amount of gaming that I do and nothing else.

I gifted my Macbook Pro to my wife so she can use it for photography and her [blog](https://www.panaceats.com), so it seemed like a good opportunity to try something new. The Google Store has a convenient 15 day return policy, so if it really does not do the job, I have two weeks to figure that out. Today is the end of the first week, and I figured it was high time to share my initial thoughts.
