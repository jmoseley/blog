Today I learned about an old project called [Gitana](https://github.com/jmoseley/Gitana) that builds an SQL db from a git repository. It does a bunch of other things too (consume issues, stackoverflow, etc) but I didn't explore any of those. I used it to do some analysis of a repo at work to extract some data about when people are merging pull requests.
