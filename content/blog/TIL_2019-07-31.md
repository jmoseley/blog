Recently I discovered the term "run those systems in anger." This was from a podcast I was listening to (either [Software Engineering Daily](https://www.softwaredaily.com/) or [YCombinator](https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/podcast/)) and the guest was talking about building software and how to choose the right frameworks/tools. The idea is that you should probably choose the tools you hate the most because you have probably spent some time "running those systems in anger," and you probably understand how it will break/fail in interesting or surprising ways and can build around those. If you choose something new and shiny, you don't yet know all those fun failure modes, so they bite you unexpectedly.
